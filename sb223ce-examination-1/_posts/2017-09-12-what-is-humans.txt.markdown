*Humansts.txt* is a text file which lies in the root folder and contains information about the people who contribute as well as software, techniques etc which has used for building the website. I configured it inside the *<head>* tag by using `<link rel="author" href="humans.txt"/>`. Below is the examplecopy of *humans.txt* file for my website
