<!-- 
    I found that, this section automatically adds twp <p> tags and I could not figure out why. After discussing with Leitet, he told me to simply add a comment about it that I found the problem but could not find the reason of it.

<section>
    {% for post in site.posts %}
    <article>
        <header>
            <h3>{{ post.title }}</h3>
            <p>Posted by <em>{{post.author}}</em> on {{post.date}}</p>
        </header>
        <p>{{post.content}}</p>
    </article>
    <hr>
    {% endfor %}
</section>
